cgx.patch:

Patch against the trunk version ofDolfyn.
The patch for dolfyn adds support for the cgx result format (.frd files):

   use,cgx

   # nodal results
   post, u, vert, yes
   post, v, vert, yes
   post, w, vert, yes
   post, p, vert, yes

Particles are not written as these are not supported by cgx results
files.

The walls are also omitted as these are available as face sets in
CGX. The exported .sur filed can be read in when viewing the
result file . Alternative by selecting 'Toggle Back/Front' the front
faces can be removed and the interior is visible.
