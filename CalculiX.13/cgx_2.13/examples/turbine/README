Purpose:
Segment of a turbo-charger turbine rotor with 12 blades
under cenrtifugal, thermal and pressure load.

Do the following:

goto ../therm and run the example to generate the temperature field
goto ../map and run the example to map the pressure and temperature
        to the mesh specified in mesh.fbl

cgx -b send.fbl
ccx latim
cgx latim.frd latim.inp

In cgx type:

copy all b2 rot x 30

REMARK:
you may change the element type in mesh.fbl:
from he20r to he8 ( or te4 or te10, but requires netgen installed) 

The file mesh.fbl is also used in ../map and ../therm
