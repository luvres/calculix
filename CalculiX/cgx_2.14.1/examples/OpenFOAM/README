Purpose:
This is a OpenFOAM example. It includes the cgx input as well as the cfd-
results. It describes a circular swirl caused by two walls who rotate relative
to each other.

To create the mesh goto:
couette/constant/polyMesh

cgx -b send.fbl

There is no need to run OpenFOAM since the results are provided.

Post-processing with:
cgx -foam couette
